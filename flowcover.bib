  abstract = {Network monitoring and measurement are crucial in network management to facilitate quality of service routing and performance evaluation. Software Defined Networking (SDN) makes network management easier by separating the control plane and data plane. Network monitoring in SDN is lightweight as operators only need to install a monitoring module into the controller. Active monitoring techniques usually introduce too many overheads into the network. The state-of-the-art approaches utilize sampling method, aggregation flow statistics and passive measurement techniques to reduce overheads. However, little work in literature has focus on reducing the communication cost of network monitoring. Moreover, most of the existing approaches select the polling switch nodes by sub-optimal local heuristics. Inspired by the visibility and central control of SDN, we propose FlowCover, a low-cost high-accuracy monitoring scheme to support various network management tasks. We leverage the global view of the network topology and active flows to minimize the communication cost by formulating the problem as a weighted set cover, which is proved to be NPhard. Heuristics are presented to obtain the polling scheme efficiently and handle flow changes practically. We build a simulator to evaluate the performance of FlowCover. Extensive experiment results show that FlowCover reduces roughly 50\% communication cost without loss of accuracy in most cases.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present OpenTM, a traffic matrix estimation system for OpenFlow networks. OpenTM uses built-in features provided in OpenFlow switches to directly and accurately measure the traffic matrix with a low overhead. Additionally, OpenTM uses the routing information learned from the OpenFlow controller to intelligently choose the switches from which to obtain flow statistics, thus reducing the load on switching elements. We explore several algorithms for choosing which switches to query, and demonstrate that there is a trade-off between accuracy of measurements, and the worst case maximum load on individual switches, i.e., the perfect load balancing scheme sometimes results in the worst estimate, and the best estimation can lead to worst case load distribution among switches. We show that a non-uniform distribution querying strategy that tends to query switches closer to the destination with a higher probability has a better performance compared to the uniform schemes. Our test-bed experiments show that for a stationary traffic matrix OpenTM normally converges within ten queries which is considerably faster than existing traffic matrix estimation techniques for traditional IP networks.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of routing connections in a large scale packet switched network supporting multipoint communications. We give a formal definition of several versions of the multipoint problem including both static and dynamic versions. We look at the Steiner tree problem as an example of the static problem and consider the experimental performance of two approximation algorithms for this problem. Then we consider a weighted greedy algorithm for a version of the dynamic problem which allows for endpoints to come and go during the life of a connection. One of the static algorithms serves as a reference to measure the performance of our weighted greedy algorithm in a series of experiments. In our conclusion, we consider areas for continued research including analysis of the probabilistic performance of multipoint approximation algorithms.},
